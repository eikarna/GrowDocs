This repostitory contain markdown files with explanations how growtopia works, but you won't find almost any code here. Based on [GrowtopiaNoobs/GrowDocs](https://github.com/GrowtopiaNoobs/GrowDocs).

There are two servers required for growtopia to work:
- [HTTP/s Server](https_server/README.md)
- [ENet Server](enet_server/README.md)

You will find under those links how each of those parts works.

Also you should check this stuff which is directly or undirectly related to packets:
- [Types Definition](types_definition.md)
- [Items Data](items_dat/README.md)
- [Packet Types](packet/README.md)
