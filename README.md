There are two servers required for growtopia to work:
- [HTTP/s Server](Docs/HTTPs%20Server/README.md)
- [ENet Server](Docs/ENet%20Server/README.md)

You will find under those links how each of those parts works.

Also you should check this stuff which is directly or undirectly related to packets:
- [Types Definition](types_definition.md)
- [Items Data](Docs/Items%20Data/README.md)
- [Packet Types](Docs/Packets/README.md)
